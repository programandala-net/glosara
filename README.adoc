== Description

Glosara is a glosser for Forth sources, though it could be used with
other programming languages as well.  Its goal is to extract the
glossary and modules documentation out of the sources and build the
documents in http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor,role="external"]
format, with cross references.

== Brief history

Glosara started in 2015-09 as part of
http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.html[Solo Forth]
(http://github.com/programandala-net/solo-forth[Solo Forth in
GitHub]), in order to build its documentation, but a few months later
it became an independent project.

== Current status

Glosara is very stable. It's being used to build the documentation of
Solo Forth and other Forth projects of the author, and it's being
completed and improved during the process.

== Requirements

Glosara uses some modules from the following libraries:

- http://irdvo.github.io/ffl/[Forth Foundation Library, role="external"]
- http://programandala.net/en.program.galope.html[Galope]
