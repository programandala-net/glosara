== Description

Glosara is a glosser for Forth sources. Its goal is to extract the
glossary and modules documentation out of the sources and build the
documents in Asciidoctor format.

At the begining Glosara was part of
http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.html[Solo Forth], in
order to build its documentation, but soon it was developed apart.

== Git repository

The Git repository of Glosara was created on 2016-04-28 out of
development backups. Later commits are real.
