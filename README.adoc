== Description

Glosara is a glosser for Forth sources. Its goal is to extract the
glossary and modules documentation out of the sources and build the
documents in Asciidoctor format, with cross references.

Glosara started as part of
http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.html[Solo Forth], in
order to build its documentation, but it became an independent project
soon.

== Current status

Glosara is being used to build the documentation of Solo Forth and it
works great. Nevertheless it's not ready to be installed because it
depends on a library of the author that has not been published yet.
