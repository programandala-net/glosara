== Description

Glosara is a glosser for Forth sources. Its goal is to extract the
glossary and modules documentation out of the sources and build the
documents in http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor,role="external"]
format, with cross references.

== Brief history

Glosara started in 2015-09 as part of
http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.html[Solo Forth]
(http://github.com/programandala-net/solo-forth[Solo Forth in
GitHub]), in order to build its documentation, but a few months later
it became an independent project.

== Current status

Glosara is being used to build the documentation of Solo Forth, and
it's being completed and improved during the process.

At the moment Glosara is not ready to be released because it depends
on a Forth library that is being prepared for release.
